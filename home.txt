						<h3 class="indent">The greatest results are those achieved through persistence, knowledge, and love of the challenge. My name is Chris Gramme and I started my journey in programming mid 2010 with vast amounts of persistence and love of the challenge at hand; simultaneously working my way to gain knowledge in the process. Eagerly, I took up Android development shortly after purchasing my first smartphone. I was immediately immersed with a vision that would eventually be my first large application. Although it was a lengthy process of research, coding, trial and error, and yet more research, my first project was finally under my belt. I was proud of the result, but craved more technical knowledge.</h3>

						<br><h3 class="indent">I knew how to develop Android applications, but desired to continue learning web development. This brought me to where I am today. I now have extensive knowledge of development skills with a variety of helpful resources to aid with creating and keeping up with current practices. As a self taught developer I can't help but accentuate my passion and experience with the mobile platform into my web applications. Two words sum it up--responsive design. I don't believe in developing websites that can't scale for an optimized experience. Although non-responsive design may not be fictional, as I would prefer, I can do my part to let us live on a planet that is plentiful with ems, percentages, meta tags, and media queries.</h3>
