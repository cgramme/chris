						<h2 id="text-title1">A little about me</h2>
						<h3 class="indent">In a brief synopsis; my name is Chris Gramme and I love creating, problem solving and designing! I started building websites as a hobby at a young age, but mid-2010 is when I truly took flight into the vast skies of application development. My passion for creating has consequently lead me to pursue a very rewarding career in web construction and progression.</h3><br />
						<h3 class="indent">Shortly after purchasing my first smart phone I found myself immersed watching countless online tutorials with a goal of creating an Android application called &quot;Car Maintenance and Fuel&quot;. Car Maintenance and Fuel was my first coding project and is the way I started teaching myself to program. After cramming my brain for thousands of hours with development practices and ideas I finally had a product that I am confident to say was one of the most rewarding undertakings I have yet encountered. When it comes down to it I love building things... I love the process of thinking my way through problems and overcoming what may or may not seem possible to overcome. </h3>
						<div class="text-painting"><p>The internet has never been so hospitable.<br /> Help others surf in style!</p></div>
						<br><h3 class="indent">I knew a good amount of Android techniques, but desired to continue learning web development. This brought me to where I am today. I now have extensive knowledge of development skills with a variety of helpful resources to aid with creating and keeping up with current practices. As a self taught developer I can't help but accentuate my passion and experience with the mobile platform into my web applications. Two words sum it up--responsive design. I am a firm believer that every website must be optimized for any condition you throw its way. Although there are many sites floating the internet without the responsive bones they deserve, I can do my part to let us live on a planet that is plentiful with ems, percentages, meta tags, and media queries.</h3>

					    <h3 class="indent">The ability to take an idea and look at it from an angle that has not yet been perceived is a quality that every creative developer strives for. Knowing how to put yourself in the shoes of the users, your boss, teammates and peers, investors or even a cave dweller who has never taseted a drop of digital water is a beautiful trait to the mind of any decent developer. Although, as someone who likes to call themselves an adequate developer these ideas scream &quot;prerequisite!&quot;.</h3>
					    <br />
					    <h3 class="indent">No matter what you may call the development of an application I am compelled to call it a romance that eventually yields a beautiful child. We know that if we nurture and take the correct steps in the development lifecycle one day a product worth applauding will emerge from our loins (cough). Knowing that we are talking about the ever changing world of web development, keeping up with the most recent best practices and compatibility information is vital to the survival of our creation and to keep it from screaming &quot;debug me!&quot; all day and night. Who likes to be loved? I do! Little Johnny Web Site also likes to be loved so give him what he needs to develop into the kung foo master he is destined to be. </h3>
