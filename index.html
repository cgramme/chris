						<h2 id="intro">A little about me</h2>
						<h3 class="indent">My name is Chris Gramme and I love making stuff! I started my journey developing mid-2010 which consequently lead me to a new passion and pursuit of a very rewarding career. Shortly after purchasing my first smart phone I found myself immersed watching countless online tutorials with a goal of creating an Android application called &quot;Car Maintenance and Fuel.&quot; Car Maintenance and Fuel was my first coding project and is the way I started teaching myself to code. After cramming my brain for thousands of hours with coding practices and ideas I finally had a product that I am confident to say was one of the most challenging yet rewarding practices I have yet encountered. When it comes down to it I love building things... I love the process of thinking my way through problems and overcoming what may or may not seem possible to overcome. </h3>
						<div class="text-painting"></div>
						<br><h3 class="indent">I knew how to develop Android applications, but desired to continue learning web development. This brought me to where I am today. I now have extensive knowledge of development skills with a variety of helpful resources to aid with creating and keeping up with current practices. As a self taught developer I can't help but accentuate my passion and experience with the mobile platform into my web applications. Two words sum it up--responsive design. I don't believe in developing websites that can't scale for an optimized experience. Although non-responsive design may not be fictional, as I would prefer, I can do my part to let us live on a planet that is plentiful with ems, percentages, meta tags, and media queries.</h3>

					  <h2 id="intro">Think inside this box</h2>
					  <h3 class="indent">The ability to take an idea and look at it from an angle that has not yet been perceived is a quality that every creative developer strives for. Knowing how to put yourself in the shoes of the users, your boss, teammates and peers, investors or even a caveman who has never seen a computer is a beautiful entity to the mind of any decent developer. Although, as someone who likes to call themselves a creative developer these ideas scream &quot;prerequisite!&quot; No matter what you call the development of an application I am compelled to call it a romance that eventually yields a beautiful child. No one wants an ugly child, so we take the correct measures in the development and growth of the fetus. We know that if we nurture and take the correct steps in the development lifecycle one day a product worth applauding will emerge from our womb. Knowing that we are talking about the ever changing world of web development, keeping up with the most recent best practices and compatibility information is vital to the survival of our creation and to keep it from screaming ”debug me” all day and night. Who likes to be loved? I do! Little Johnny Web Site also likes to be loved so give him what he needs to develop into the kung foo master he is destined to be. </h3>
