								<h2>Code Odyssey</h2>
								<p class="indent">Code Odyssey is a website I created to teach aspiring web-developers basic web technologies, tips, tricks, and some intermediate to advanced coding practices. My inspiration for creating the site was to give young and intermediate developers a free place to either learn on a step by step system, or simply to use it as a handy reference. Code Odyssey is a work in progress with much room to grow into the full potential I have planned for its future updates.</p>
